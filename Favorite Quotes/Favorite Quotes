Galileo:
"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use"
"And yet it moves..."

Robert E Lee:
"I think it wiser not... to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations, who endeavored to obliterate the marks
of civil strife, to commit to oblivion, the feelings engendered"
